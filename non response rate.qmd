# Introduction

Nonresponse rates underlie significant concerns especially in survey research as high nonresponse rates tend to lead to various biases and affect the validity of the findings. The "Special Virtual Issue on Nonresponse Rates and Nonresponse Adjustments" of the *Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology* discussed various aspects and adjustments around nonreponse rates to enhance the understanding of this critical issue [@cite1]. Emphasizing the importance of addressing nonresponse in survey research, the editorial highlights the need for methodological advancements to improve the quality of survey data. To further delve into the issue, this paper focus on the impact, factors, and preventions of mode effects on nonresponse rates.

# Understanding Nonresponse and Its Impact

While conducting surveys and collecting data for research, researchers tend to collect data from sample the population that are able to represent the population instead of attempting the virtually imposible task of collecting data from every single individual of the population. However, during survey data collection, nonresponse often occurs when sampled individuals or units fail to participate or provide complete data.

High nonreponse rates are likely to lead to nonresponse bias, where the characteristics of respondents differ from those of nonrespondents [@cite2]. Nonresponse can reduce the effective sample size, and limit the accuracy of survey results. Nonresponse bias is extremely difficult to determine given the lack of data; therefore, in order to ensure the accuracy of survey estimates and the validity of the findings, it is important to capture as much data as possible from the respondents [@cite3].

# Mode Effects

Mode effects on nonresponse rates refers to the variation in response rates observed across different modes of data collection in survey research. Different survey modes, such as face-to-face interviews, telephone interviews, mail surveys, and online questionnaire may induce different levels of partipation from respondents.

## Factors Influencing Mode Effects

Factors that contribute to mode effects may vary. The most obvious factors that exhibit strong influence on mode effects are the characteristics of the survey mode. Each of the survey modes mentioned earlier has unique characteristics that may influence response rates. Research has indicated that face-to-face interviews have higher response rates than other modes of surveys [@cite5]. This phenomenon could be attributed the fact that face-to-face interview provide the sense of intimacy between the interviewers and respondents that other modes cannot. This encourages more participation and higher rates of answering all the questions. Telephone surveys offer greater reach than face-to-face interview but may encounter distrust from respondents about privacy or telemarketing. Nowadays, the most convenient form of survey is online surveys. This mode of data collection may lead to sample bias due to its potential to only attract respondents with specific characteristics. However, contrary to the genearal assumption that anonymous online surveys results in higher response rates, research shows that there is no difference in terms of response rates based on confidentiality [@cite6].

While the survey mode matters, respondents preference cannot be overlooked.I Individuals may have different preferences over survey modes based on their communication preferences, technological literacy, and availability. For example, while older respondents may prefer the traditional face-to-face interview, younger individuals might favor online survey for convenience. To maximum response rates, it is crucial to select the appropriate survey mode based on respondents' preferences.

Survey administration procedures also have a significant influence on the response rates. Factors such as survey length, question wording, or even the time when the survey is conducted are all correlated with response rates. Studies demonstrated a substantial decrease in response rates for surveys with more than 12 questions or taking more than 5 minutes to complete [@cite7]

## Mitigating Mode Effects

Mitigating mode effects requires careful consideration and implementation of survey design. One approach is mixed mode survey design. Researchers could develop the same survey into different modes and allow participants to choose the mode they are most comfortable in participating with. This method garners higher response rates by reaching people through different modes [@cite8].

Another effective way to mitigate mode effects is mode specific questionnaire design. Understanding that different modes of survey may each have its pros and cons, they could tailor questions to the characteristics of each mode. For example, designing shorter questions for online surveys and employ more conversational languages in face-to-face interviews may both drive up participation rate that results in data completeness.

These strategies do not cover all methods to minimize mode effects. Survey designers could also carefully monitor response rates and data quality over time, analyzing trends to inform adjustments in survey design. Researchers could also reweight survey data in accordance to the difference in response rates across modes. Regardless of the chosen approach, it is essential to recognize the potential bias introduced by different survey modes and employ rigorous methodologies to enhance data validity.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, a comprehensive understanding and skillful management of response rates are important in survey research. The "Special Virtual Issue on Nonresponse Rates and Nonresponse Adjustments" [@cite1] provides valuable insights regarding the importance of improving methodogies in enhancing the data quality, and a specific aspect they consider is the mode effects on nonresponse rates.

Mode effects significantly influence nonresponse rates in survey research. This paper underscores the importance of identifying factors contributing to mode effects and implementing effective mitigation strategies. These effects are influenced by various factors, including survey mode characteristics, respondent preferences, and administration procedures. Mitigation strategies include mixed mode survey design, mode-specific questionnaire design, and careful consideration of survey administration procedures. However, it is important to acknowledge that the effectiveness of these strategies may vary across different situations and contexts. Future investigations are needed to explore the efficacy of different mitigation strategies in diverse environments.

Recognizing the variability in response rates and respondent behaviors across different survey modes enables researchers to implement tailored strategies for different respondent cohorts, thereby mitigating mode effects and improving data quality. Overall, considering mode effects in survey design and analysis is essential for obtaining quality data and making valid findings.
